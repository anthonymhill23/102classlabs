# What is CSS

CSS also known as Cascading Style Sheets is what allows you to creat great operating web pages. If HTML is the Meat and Potatpes of your website's stew, then  CSS is all the spices that give it flavor. However to use CSS properly, a Bit of HTML knowledge is necessary. Basic level HTML knowledge should suffice. 

## What is CSS for? 
CSS is a language used to dictate how a website is presented to the user (generally the person using the website) on the user agent( a user agent is whatever browser the user is using so that will vary)

## CSS Syntax
Css is a rule based language, by that i mean the programmer defines rules specifying groups of styles that should be applied to paticular elements or groups of elements on the web page. 
an example of this would be

```css
h1{
    color:red;
    font size: 5em;
}
``` 
what this does is open with a selector, which  selects the HTML elements that we are going to syele, in this case, we are styling Level one headings

In most coding languages CSS can be used to style a website, It takes it from a regular bry page to something with some pizzazz
