    <p>Let me tell you why tostadas are superior! tostadas allow for more toppings then tacos shells. WHen you make a taco in a hard taco shell, you have only so much space to add your meat, your guac, tomatoes, sour creem, refried beans, cheese and anything else you wanna have. With a tostada, you build out the diameater of the shell, and then you build up, leading to more topings and meat over all. Another great benefit is for cooking, it requires less work then a typical American taco shell to make. Can save time when trying to shale an American taco shell. All in all, tostadas are the SUPERIOR SHELL.   </p>
